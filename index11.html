  Harry James Potter is a fictional character in the 
  Harry Potter series of novels by J. K. Rowling. 
  The plot of the seven-book series chronicles seven years 
  in the life of the orphan Harry, who, on his eleventh birthday, 
  learns he is a wizard. He attends Hogwarts, a school of magic, 
  where he receives guidance from the headmaster 
  Albus Dumbledore and becomes friends with Ron Weasley and 
  Hermione Granger. Harry learns that during his infancy, the Dark 
  wizard Lord Voldemort murdered his parents but was unable to kill 
  him as well. The novels (and the films based on them) revolve 
  around Harry's struggle to adapt to the wizarding world and defeat 
  Voldemort.
